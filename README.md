# cv-radar

This is a computer vision system for detecting car speeds from video footage, currently from the BrnoCompSpeed dataset. This is a "tracking by detection model".

The program uses YOLOv5 as its detection model, followed by deepSORT to track the cars.

## Requirements

Python, Jupyter Kernel, opencv-python, torch, deep_sort_realtime
